MP3 Tag Reader Description

The MP3 Tag Reader Project is a program developed using the C programming language that allows users to read and extract metadata (tags) from MP3 audio files. MP3 files typically contain information such as the artist name, album title, track number, year, genre, and other metadata, which is stored in ID3 tags. These tags help users organize and identify their music files.
